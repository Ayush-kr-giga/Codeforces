# Problem: Maximum Number of Coins

## Problem Statement
Initially, you have a coin with value \( n \). You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

- Transform one coin with value \( x \) (\( x > 3 \)) into two coins, each with value \( \lfloor \frac{x}{4} \rfloor \).

What is the maximum number of coins you can have after performing this operation any number of times?

---

## Input Format
- The first line contains one integer \( t \) (\( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \)) — the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of one line containing one integer \( n \) (\( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \)).

---

## Output Format
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of coins you can have after performing the operation any number of times.

## Explanation

### Observations
1. **Recursive Behavior**:
   - If \( n > 3 \), transforming one coin of value \( n \) into two coins of value \( \lfloor \frac{n}{4} \rfloor \) results in more coins but smaller values.
   - The process continues until \( n \leq 3 \), where no more transformations are possible.

2. **Smallest Coin Value**:
   - Coins with values \( \leq 3 \) cannot be split further. These are the "terminal" coins.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - For a given \( n \), the number of resulting coins is equivalent to the total coins generated by recursively splitting \( n \) into smaller coins.
   - The operation ensures all coins reduce to terminal values (\( 1, 2, 3 \)).

4. **Recursive Formula**:
   \[
   \text{MaxCoins}(n) =
   \begin{cases} 
      1 & \text{if } n \leq 3 \\
      \text{MaxCoins}\left(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\right) + \text{MaxCoins}\left(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor\right) & \text{if } n > 3
   \end{cases}
   \]
