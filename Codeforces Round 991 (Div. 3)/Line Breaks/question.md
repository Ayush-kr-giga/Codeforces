Kostya has a text a consisting of it words made up of Latin siphabet letters. He also has two strips on which he must write the best. The first strip can hold m characters, while the second can hold as many as needed.

Kostya must choose a number x and write the first x words from a on the first strip, while all the remaining words are written on the second strip. To save space, the words are written without gaps, but each word must be entirely on one strip.

Since space on the second strip is very valuable, Kostya asks you to choose the maximum possible number x such that all words fit on the first strip of length m.

Input

The first line contains an integer f (1sis 1000) the number of test cases.

The first line of sach test case contains two integers & and m (1≤≤50:1sms500) the number of words in the list and the maximum number of characters that can be on the first strip.

The next in lines contain one word s, of lowercase Latin letters, where the length of a, does not exceed 10.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum number of words X such that the first x words have a total length of no more than m
