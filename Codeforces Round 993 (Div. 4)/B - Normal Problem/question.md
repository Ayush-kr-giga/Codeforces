# Normal Problem

## Problem Description

A string consisting of only characters `'p'`, `'q'`, and `'w'` is painted on a glass window of a store. Ship walks past the store, standing directly in front of the glass window, and observes string \( a \). Ship then heads inside the store, looks directly at the same glass window, and observes string \( b \).

Your task is to determine string \( b \) given string \( a \).

## Input Format

1. The first line contains an integer \( t \) \((1 \leq t \leq 100)\) — the number of test cases.
2. Each of the next \( t \) lines contains a string \( a \) \((1 \leq |a| \leq 100)\) — the string Ship observes from outside the store.  
   It is guaranteed that \( a \) only contains the characters `'p'`, `'q'`, and `'w'`.

---

## Output Format

For each test case, output string \( b \), the string Ship observes from inside the store, on a new line.

---

## Constraints

- \( 1 \leq t \leq 100 \)
- \( 1 \leq |a| \leq 100 \)
- \( a \) only contains the characters `'p'`, `'q'`, and `'w'`.
