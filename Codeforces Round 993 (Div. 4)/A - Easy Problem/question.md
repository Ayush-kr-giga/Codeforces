# Easy Problem

## Problem Description

Cube is given an integer \( n \). She wants to know how many **ordered pairs** of positive integers \( (a, b) \) satisfy the equation:  
\[
a = n - b
\]  
where \( a > 0 \) and \( b > 0 \). Your task is to help Cube determine the number of such pairs for each given \( n \).

---

## Input Format

1. The first line contains an integer \( t \) \((1 \leq t \leq 99)\) â€” the number of test cases.
2. The only line of each test case contains an integer \( n \) \((2 \leq n \leq 100)\).

---

## Output Format

For each test case, output the number of valid ordered pairs \( (a, b) \) on a new line.

---

## Constraints

- \( 1 \leq t \leq 99 \)
- \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \)
